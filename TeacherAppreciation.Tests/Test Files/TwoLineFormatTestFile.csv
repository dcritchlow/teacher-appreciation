Connie is our Science teacher in rotations. The kids love going to science and learning new and interesting things. Ever since Connie took this assignment our science scores have been improving.  She has helped me as a teacher be more supportive in including science concepts in my reading and math curriculum to help the kids make more connections to other areas of their life. Connie has also taken on the responsibility of organizing the Science Fair. Her efforts have really paid off. We have had the best participation in years with all grades.

4943,11/3/2015 9:00,Ashley Madsen Quick,AQuick@dcsd.org,435-828-4842,Neola Elementary,Duchesne,4th and Kindergarten,Yes,"  Ashley is very dedicated to teaching the students. She is ready and willing to go the extra mile to make sure all students get an excellent education. 
 This year Ashley took on a particularly difficult task of teaching the fourth grade students in the morning who needed a smaller class and a little extra boost to get on track and have a positive educational experience. In the afternoon she was willing to take the afternoon kindergarten students and teach them. 
  Ashley has done an excellent job in adjusting with both of these grade levels. The fourth grade students have made great gains and her kindergarten students are growing at a fast pace as well. 
  Ashley understands technology and is one of our teachers who makes sure all the other teachers are able to use their electronic devices to their fullest. She is always willing to step up and take on more responsibility and assist others where needed.
  She was able to assist our district during the summer months to come up with some testing for math at the kindergarten level that will help us know where our students are as far as mastery and growth.
  Ashley is a great help to our school and community. She is a pleasure to work with. ","  Our fourth grade students who need some intensive help with math have been going to Ashley's class in the morning hours. They are making great strides in understanding the math concepts she has been teaching.
