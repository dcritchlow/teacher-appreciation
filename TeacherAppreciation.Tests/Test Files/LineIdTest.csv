Connie is constantly working to better understand the CORE and implement it in a more effective way. Every year she has new ideas to make our teaching more on target and interesting to the students.  Connie is our Science teacher in rotations. The kids love going to science and learning new and interesting things. Ever since Connie took this assignment our science scores have been improving.  She has helped me as a teacher be more supportive in including science concepts in my reading and math curriculum to help the kids make more connections to other areas of their life. Connie has also taken on the responsibility of organizing the Science Fair. Her efforts have really paid off. We have had the best participation in years with all grades.
