 This year Ashley took on a particularly difficult task of teaching the fourth grade students in the morning who needed a smaller class and a little extra boost to get on track and have a positive educational experience. In the afternoon she was willing to take the afternoon kindergarten students and teach them. 
  Ashley has done an excellent job in adjusting with both of these grade levels. The fourth grade students have made great gains and her kindergarten students are growing at a fast pace as well. 
  Ashley understands technology and is one of our teachers who makes sure all the other teachers are able to use their electronic devices to their fullest. She is always willing to step up and take on more responsibility and assist others where needed.
  She was able to assist our district during the summer months to come up with some testing for math at the kindergarten level that will help us know where our students are as far as mastery and growth.
  Ashley is a great help to our school and community. She is a pleasure to work with. ","  Our fourth grade students who need some intensive help with math have been going to Ashley's class in the morning hours. They are making great strides in understanding the math concepts she has been teaching.

4955,11/5/2015 14:55,Courtnee Meek,courtnee.meek@jordandistrict.org,626-827-3617,West Jordan High School,Jordan,10th grade LA and AP Literature,No,"    Courtnee Meek displays excellence in teaching every day.  When she transferred to West Jordan  it became clear to our veteran English department that she had much to teach us.  I share a wall with Courtnee  a wall that until last summer was a soft wall that didn’t block out much sound.  I was able to hear her consistently displaying all of the qualities you would expect from a seasoned  effective  exemplary teacher.
    Courtnee has the ability to thoughtfully plan  making sure that every detail of her instruction is aligned to core standards and is engaging for her students.  She is always prepared and effectively transitions between activities. She maintains great management  not through heavy-handed discipline or a lengthy list of rules.  She cultivates relationships that foster mutual respect and makes her curriculum very relatable to her students.  
    Courtnee goes well beyond being a good practioner.  If there is a need  she is the first to volunteer to help.  She teaches one of our remedial classes. This year  she had taken over a reading intervention program called Power 30.  She spent the summer developing weekly lesson plans and building cohorts consisting of 5 or 6 students and a teacher.  The groups meet weekly for reading strategy instruction and relationship-building.  Courtnee reaches out to each of these approximately 50 students on a regular basis. She instills confidence and encourages their continuing success.  She works with teachers to modify plans to meet their needs and those of their students.
    Another thing Courtnee has taken on this year is our AP Literature class.  Our school is trying to grow our AP offerings  especially since our population (around 70% on free or reduced lunch) needs support in preparing and planning to attend college.  The class has grown considerably this year.  The ability to equally meet the needs of remedial sophomores and accelerated juniors and seniors shows both the range and capacity of this wonderful teacher.
    Courtnee is also adept at developing meaningful professional relationships. She is a vital member of the English department  where she shares ideas and expertise with the members of our team.  She assists teachers in using technology.  She is part of Blue Crew  a teacher club at our school that supports students outside of the classroom by attending games  performances  assemblies  etc.  I have seen her help mentor new teachers this year in a variety of departments.  
","    One group of students Courtnee has had a positive impact on is our Power 30 kids.  These are sophomores who are below-level readers not being served by other programs at our school. She talks to them individually and makes them understand how to be accountable for their own learning.  She creates lesson plans that will engage them and build the skills to help them succeed in all of their classes. She is constantly looking for ways to motivate them and celebrate their successes. 
    As good as she is with groups of students  I think she really excels at building one-on-one relationships.  Students know she cares not only about their success in English  but their success in life in general.  Last year  Courtnee had a student in her class that has severe anger-management issues.  He had a record of acting out in a variety of classes.  Courtnee took the time to build a relationship with him and help him come up with a plan to make sure he could manage his issues in a way that would not disrupt the rest of the class.  Together  they decided that if something happened that would set him off  he would take the hall pass and just walk the halls for a minute or two until he was able to return to class.  That seems like a simple thing – a management issue – but it made a world of difference to this student.  In looking at his academic history  he has a history of failing classes or receiving No-Grades for poor attendance.  Last year in Courtnee’s class  he passed every quarter.  She made it comfortable for him to be there and helped him cope with his issues  not allowing them to derail his success in her class or label him in a negative way.  Her positive influence didn’t stop there.   This student was devastated and angry when our football coach announced he was leaving at the end of the year.  He sought out someone he could trust. Courtnee found him outside her room crying tears of frustration. She allowed him to talk out his feelings in the safe  supporting environment she had created for him.  She has helped other teachers understand how to help him have the best chance of success in their classes.  This is one of many examples of her positive impact on the students lucky enough to be in her classes.

4979,11/13/2015 17:07,Dale Griffiths,dgriffiths@dsdmail.com,801-402-2750,West Point Elementary,Davis,4th Grade,Not sure,Mr. Griffiths is so dedicated to each and every student. While at parent teacher conferences he makes sure to give specific examples of students successes with such genuine praise. As a parent  I have had two children in his class. We are so lucky to have his excitement and enthusiasm for learning in our lives. As a teacher  he can get almost all of his students to be just as excited as he is. I know this sounds like a commonplace occurrence  I can't really express how valuable an educator he is and the influence he has on each and every student. He gets to know all of the students and the nuances of their personalities. He is the teacher every kids makes sure they go back and say hi to after they have had the wonderful experience of being in his class. I have had kids in the public school system for the last 11 years and he is by far one of the best teachers we have ever had the opportunity to interact with. ,I was a little concerned to have my daughter follow her older sister in his class. I knew my older daughter had made such a connection with Mr. Griffiths and I was concerned their would be comparisons and my younger daughter might feel she wasn't living up to her older sister. Mr. Griffiths has gone out of his way to bring out the strong points of my younger daughter. At parent teacher conference he went out of his way to let her know that in his class she was her own person and didn't need to feel that she was being compared to her older sister. ,Heidi Cottle,addygcottle@yahoo.com,8018256162
4991,11/20/2015 13:06,Ric Jaggi,ric.jaggi@washk12.org,435-668-2704,Fossil Ridge Intermediate,Washington,6th Grade Science,Yes,"Ric Jaggi is a stellar example of “Excellence in Teaching”.  I have had the privilege of working with Ric as a team member  colleague  and friend for the past ten years.  He is currently a sixth grade teacher at Fossil Ridge Intermediate School.  Ric sets high standards for his students in both academics and behavior.  The population of our school is over 60% free and reduced lunch  25% minority  and 15% special ed.  All science classes are inclusion classes without the assistance of a co-teacher.  Because of Ric’s teaching style  severe special ed kids are regularly placed in his class to expose them to the regular classroom  their peers  and the science curriculum.  Even though it is a challenge for the students  they all find success in Ric’s classroom.  Ric and his team consistently have some of the top proficiency scores in the state  amongst middle/intermediate schools  on end-of –year testing.

Ric is always looking to keep up with best teaching practices in science and is constantly revising lessons and making new lessons to reflect that.  I have seen a change in his lesson style over the years.  He has made a conscious effort to make science more hands on and exploratory for his students.  You will often find him in the lab where he is serving as a facilitator of the learning that is taking place while the children do the hands on work.

Our school website has links to teacher websites.  Ric has taken on the responsibility of adding links for all sixth grade science students to use.  Ric is not a technology whiz  but volunteered to learn how to do the links page to benefit all of the students.  He then took things one step further and has made web based lessons using the links for each of the standards.

An excellent teacher’s influence reaches beyond the walls of their own classroom.  Ric truly has the best interest of his science teacher team and all of their students in mind.  He is an amazing person to team with.  He is always willing to jump in and help with anything.  He is a good listener and contributes to benefit all of our sixth graders.  He always shares his good ideas and doesn’t keep them to himself.  Ric is a team player in every way.
","Ric impacts our entire student body through his selfless acts of sharing lessons and resources  but he also has had impact on many students as well as their parents throughout his career.  In recent years  Ric has come up with an innovative email format to help his “parents” interact with their children.

When it comes to parent communication  Ric is an expert.  His emails are not simply informative to the parents about what is going on in his classroom  but they help the parents know how to communicate to their children.  We have a challenging population of students at our school; many are being raised in single parent homes and some are in homes without their parents.  Often when daily life is so challenging for “parents”  many are ill equipped on how to approach school related discussions with their children.  Ric has come up with a brilliant solution to this problem.  He has designed his parent emails to be a question and answer conversation between the parents and their children.  It includes questions to be asked  expected responses  and what the correct response should be.

He guides parents through things like how to help with the assigned homework  how to guide their children through science projects  and how to help them study for tests.  Many parents have found Ric’s email style so helpful.  They have even sent him emails thanking him.  “I want to thank you for your communication.  You make it easy to remind her about her work!” – Liz R.  “Thanks so much for all your emails.  It’s so nice to not have to read between the lines of what my son remembers about his class/assignments!!  Thanks this really helps me as a mom following up with him.” – Charlyn T.  “Thank you for keeping us up on what you are doing in class!  It sure makes it nice for us as parents to know what questions we should be asking and the correct answers we should be expecting in return.” – Steve and Becky P.	

The extent of Ric’s impact is not only from team member to team member  or teacher to student  but from teacher to parent which impacts future children that Ric may never come into contact with.

She is in tune to the needs of the families and makes them feel welcomed and at home at the school.

","The students at our school have a unique set of needs  including emotionally  academically  financially and with the language.  Many students come to school hungry and without necessary supplies.  Kim Hawkins has brought programs to her school to provide food  clothing  coats and school supplies for hundreds of students.

5026,12/1/2015 17:54,Jeffrey Craig Ballard,jeff.ballard@nebo.edu,801-661-6632,Rees Elementary,Nebo,4th grade,Yes,"Mr. Ballard has always gone above and beyond for his students. When he was first teaching  he and his team read a lot of research that showed a better way of teaching students  they took that research to their principal and got him on board with this new idea. With some tweaking every year  they were able to assimilate this idea  Multi-age Classrooms  into the culture of Rees Elementary.  They took mainstream students and students with learning disabilities and put them into the same classes  and mixed students of various grades.  They had 3rd  4th  and 5th grade students all in the same class.  It worked out wonderfully with Mr. Ballard  Mrs. Creer  Mr. Roberts  and Mrs. Beyal leading the students through experiencing what it means to be respectful  hardworking  and loving. 
 Mr. Ballard has focused on making learning an experience.  He has never taught with the end goal of testing in mind  instead he teaches with the goal of achieving success in life.  His students know that he cares about them and it shows in their willingness to work and their determination to continue learning. Mr. Ballard has inspired many to join the league of teachers  including myself. He never counted down the days of school because each day was too precious.  He challenges the students to want to be better and expects them to rise to the challenge. ","     Mr. Ballard has submitted  every year  for grants to help provide experiences for his students. 
     One year  he received the Toyota Tapestry grant and was able to take the whole 4th grade in his school on various extended field trips all over Utah to experience its history.  When they returned from their field trips  they used the most current technology at the time to create virtual field trips for those who couldn't attend. 
     He also helps his school receive the Artist in Residence grants every year  which allows for professional artists to come and teach 4-8 week workshops to the students. This has allowed Rees Elementary School to be recognized as a school that truly values the arts. Many students have left Rees and excelled in the arts throughout the remainder of their lives.
     Due to the Artist in Residence grant  he created his own African Drum group.  The students are taught some simple rhythms for their auditions. Once the students are chosen for the group  they practice several times a week and even go on tour"" playing at many of the elementary schools in our district.",,,
     Mr. Ballard loves to use simulations during his teaching. While teaching a unit on community  he has the students bring in boxes and they design  create  and live their own community in their classroom.  While teaching about the Pioneers  the students participate in a Pioneer school house following the lifestyle of the pioneers they are studying.  While exploring the Westward Movement  they research pioneer families that traveled westward along the Oregon Trail and become those families. They build a sense of belonging and battle together through the trials the pioneers faced.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"     Although none of these examples are geared toward one student  or even one year of students  these are the experiences that have changed many of the students' lives that Jeff Ballard has taught. Just this last year the district made the decision to do away with the Multi-age program  so the parents threw a ""Multi-age Going Away (Funeral)"" for the teachers and students.  These were the experiences that many of those in attendance were talking about and reminiscing through  even though many have their own families and careers now (Jeff has been teaching for 30 years this year  and plans to continue teaching elsewhere even after retiring).""",Caitlin Paige Ossmen,caitlin.ossmen@nebo.edu,801-361-4688,,,,,,,,,,

He motivates his students to excel and learn. He gives them the extra time and attention they need to help them improve on their skills. Mr. Dye is tireless in his service to his students. He tries to understand the students problems and concerns and knows each student individually. He asks for a lot from his students and they give him 101%. He tries to make every student welcome. Mr. Dye not only teaches the band class  but he is a business manager  tour director  costume designer  or whatever else he needs to do to make the band program run smoothly.

Mr. Dye spends extra time after school helping students. A lot of times he'll be practicing with the band during an after school practice and he sets the goal and lets them leave early once the band reaches the goal. He excels at sharing his vision with the band and they willing follow him  whether its through a rainy marching band practice  basketball pep band  or a concert. He brings music to the students of Kearns High School.

Mr. Dye understands the importance of family life  and lets students balance school and family when there are conflicts with after school activities.

Mr. Dye always responds in a kind and caring manner for those students who may be having a rough time  even if the reason is not band related. He cares about his students and it shows in the way he knows how to relate to them. He knows about their struggles and enjoys watching them succeed. ","My daughter was going into 7th grade last summer and was invited to join the marching band for the summer parade season. She learned more on how to play the flute during those few practice times then she had from any other teacher in such a short amount of time. 

He knows how to help a group grow together to give their best group effort. His class isn't a band class  it's a band family.

Kearns High School has a large minority population and its students come from many different backgrounds  Caucasian  African-American  Latino  Polynesian. Mr. Dye's band room is one of the few places in the school where race doesn't seem to matter  the students don't group apart like the do in the halls or in other parts of the school. It's the band family first.

When my oldest daughter wanted to be in color guard  even though she was the only member of the guard  Mr. Dye let her join. He arranged for an adviser and she was able to perform with the marching band. This year  thanks partly to Mr. Dye for encouraging the guard  even when it was only one member  there are more members and the Kearns High School color guard is alive once again.

My daughter's high school experience is enriched greatly by Mr. Dye's band programs and the countless hours he devotes to his students. I have watched her grow as a color guard member and as a musician from her time as his student. My daughter in seventh grade can't wait to be a part of the Kearns High School band and a student of Mr. Dye from her brief experience in summer marching band. Both of my daughters have enjoyed having Mr. Dye as a teacher and eagerly look forward to band.

5066,12/9/2015 16:26,Dirk Moore,kemoore@wsd.net,8014765320,Sand Ridge Junior High,Weber ,8th grade,Yes,"Mr.Moore exemplifies 'Excellence in Teaching' for many reasons. One one which is the way that he takes time with each student to make sure that they understand the topic at hand. Another reason  is that Mr. Moore uses many different teaching methods to teach students with different learning styles. For example  he teaches using drawing for vocabulary  and listing to audios for warm-up journals. 
","Mr. Moore has probably impacted many students as a teacher. But I know that Mr. Moore has affected my life greatly. 
Mr. Moore has made history fun  entertaining and wonderful for me. Before I started his class  history was  by far  my least favorite class. Mr. Moore has changed that drastically. Thanks to him  his history class is one of the most engaging and convivial classes to me. ",Chayse Elizabeth Felt,chaysefelt@gmail.com,8016034986

She is a very great teacher with many unique ideas and assignments  plus she is super motivating and creative. Not only that but she is also a great Spanish teacher. She isn't one at the school now but last year in Spanish she was a student teacher  for about a Quarter of the year. I thank her for a lot of my Spanish 1 teaching and words. Then at the start of this year I found out she was my English teacher  I was pretty happy. Even over the second semester and summer of last year she remembered my name. That shows compassion.,She is responsible for a lot of my Spanish 1 teaching and a lot of students in the classes that she was a student teacher in. She also has a lot of creativity for being a English teacher. That is why I nominate her for the Excellence in teaching award.,Braden Reed,reedbr1@wsdstudent.net,801-732-0668
5070,12/9/2015 22:35,Cheryl Leifson,cheryl.leifson@nebo.edu,801-372-5968,Park Elementary School,Nebo School District,Kindergarten,Yes,"I have had the pleasure of being Cheryl’s colleague for the past seven years.  Cheryl constantly has dedicated herself to going above and beyond what has been required in order to ensure that all of her students are successful in mastering the curriculum as well as developing a love for learning and an understanding of leadership roles and responsibilities.  Her students are certain to be tomorrow’s leaders. Cheryl goes above and beyond in preparations for student programs such as the Christmas and graduation programs.  Her preparations  audio-visual creations and imaginative activities add to the success of the entire grade level  and regularly bring tears to the eyes of parents and grandparents. Cheryl has dedicated many hours to the success of student teachers that she has helped to hone the craft of teaching.   She gives them instructive feedback as well as excellent modeling of the best and most up to date practices.  

Cheryl is able to be successful in her own teaching and training of pre-service teachers because of her own attention to preparation and constant desire for professional development.  Cheryl frequently attends optional teacher training and works to attain additional endorsements that help in instructing her students.  Cheryl is always excited to implement new learning in her classroom each time she learns a new technique.  This frequently results in fun and delightful lessons that benefit the students' learning.  Cheryl is always very organized and prepared for her teaching.  She arrives at school an hour and a half early each day to be ready.  She keeps things well paced in her classes and keeps in mind the needs of all the different learners  frequently differentiating her instructional techniques to meet individual needs.  Cheryl has the ability to take something that needs to be taught and to put it into a simple  understandable and memorable way for her kindergarten students to understand.  She regularly shares her insight with fellow teachers  allowing them to gain effective techniques that can benefit all students.  Regularly she finds new materials or teaching techniques and shares them with the rest of the kindergarten team; most recently a sight word footprint walkway for students to step on and read as they enter the classroom each day.  She frequently employs the latest technology and combines that technology with engaging activities that allow students to move and wiggle while learning important core concepts. 
","A really significant thing about Cheryl is how she helps students to feel special and important.  She has conducted visits to many student homes to meet them before school starts.  Her students love her and come back year after year to say  “Hi ” and get a hug.  Teaching is her passion  she loves children and the classroom is her “happy place”.
Examples of this caring in action include instances when former students faced challenges in their lives. Cheryl had one student whose family experienced some difficulties that necessitated home-schooling the student.  Cheryl made several trips to the child’s home to work with the parents to make sure that the learning opportunities continued and also made sure that the family had any resource they needed to continue learning the kindergarten curriculum.  Another student needed heart surgery.  The child’s mother was concerned about the long absence and how the other students would react to this child’s challenge.  Cheryl had the parent come into the classroom and explain what was happening and how her son would be impacted by the surgery.  She brought in surgical masks for all the students in the class to wear and discussed how the other students could help their classmate feel comfortable when he returned to class.  Cheryl made this a memorable experience for the students and all the participants benefited from this experience.  Cheryl later took a meal to the family when the student got home from the hospital and made additional visits to ensure that he stayed caught up with his school work.  

Cheryl Leifson is a very caring  talented  and professional teacher who definitely deserves recognition for her constant devotion and dedication to the teaching profession and the families and students who she serves!

5072,12/10/2015 23:04,Megan Askew,maskew@murrayschools.org,801-556-4760,Horizon Elementary,Murray City,3rd,No,Megan Askew works tireless hours and is completely dedicated to meeting the needs of all her students. She differentiates instruction  plans engaging lessons  and shows her students that she truly cares about them. She runs a homework club on her own time every day  so that students can get the help they need. She has been teaching in Title One schools for over 10 years. Her students come from diverse backgrounds  and have many diverse needs. She always rises to the occasion to meet their emotional and academic needs.,"1. Last year  Mrs. Askew learned at the beginning of the year  that one of her students was deaf in one ear. She immediately sent emails  made phone calls  and got him a sound system for the classroom that helped his ability to learn. She did not understand why one of these was not already in place for this child  but did what needed to be done. Mrs. Askew will stop at nothing to meet the needs of all her students. I know this student and his parents were very grateful for her persistence and dedication.
2. The first question she asks when a student doesn't feel well in the morning is  did you eat breakfast? If they say no  she finds something for them.  
3. Tough behavior students are constantly placed in her class year after year. That is because she is patient  consistent  structured  engaging  and caring. That is an Excellence in Teaching combination!",Merissa Graves,merissa630@yahoo.com,801-556-4760
